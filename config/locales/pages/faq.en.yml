        ## HOW DO I DOWNLOAD THE MOBILE APP?
        You can download the ParkMobile app in your device's app store or market.

        ## WHO CAN I CONTACT FOR MORE HELP?
        We are happy to help! Search for a wide variety of topics in our Help Center or create a support ticket if you need more help. We'll respond as soon as possible to help resolve your questions.

        ## HOW DO I GET MY PARKING HISTORY?
        You can view your parking history in the ParkMobile app under the “My Parking” section there is a history tab. The ParkMobile app shows just your recent history, which can be accessed by logging in and tapping "My Parking" then "History".

        ## CAN I EXTEND MY TIME?
        Yes! You can extend your parking session in zones while your session is still active. If you can’t extend your time in zones where extensions are accepted, it could be because your initial session has already ended. The extension can be made by accessing the Mobile App → My Parking → Current → More Details

        ## HOW CAN I RESET MY PASSWORD OR UNLOCK MY ACCOUNT?
        It’s quick and easy to reset your password! In the app, tap "Forgot your Password" and enter the email associated with your ParkSmart account and tap "Submit". You will then be sent an email with reset instructions.

        ## CAN I CANCEL MY ACCOUNT?
        We'd hate to see you go! To cancel your account, you can open a support ticket in the Help Center. In the ticket, please include the email address/mobile number on your account and the last four digits of the credit card on file (you can provide your License Plate Number on your account if you don't use a credit card as a payment method). If you are willing to share, please also include the reason you are canceling so that we can continue to make improvements to the ParkSmart app.

        ## CAN I STOP OR CANCEL MY SESSION?
        If you start a session, stopping it early isn’t allowed and your session will automatically end at the deactivation time shown.

        ## WHY IS MY ACCOUNT SUSPENDED?
        Your account will be suspended if the credit card on file has expired or if you have experienced a payment failure resulting in a balance due. But don’t worry, it’s easy to fix! In either case, you'll need to fill your wallet from the “My Wallet” section under “My Account”.

        ## HOW DOES ENFORCEMENT KNOW I PAID? WHAT IF I GET A TICKET?
        The parking meters and kiosks don’t sync with our system, but local parking enforcement will see your mobile payment on their handheld device. We would hate for any of our users to receive a ticket! In the event that you do receive a ticket even after paying, verify that you used the correct license plate number. You will need to submit your dispute using our mobile application.

        ## CAN I GET A REFUND?
        ParkSmart cannot refund your parking session once created.

        ## HOW DO I KNOW MY PARKING SESSION HAS STARTED?
        When using the app, you will know your parking session has successfully started once you see the countdown timer on the Active Sessions screen (My Parking → Current). You will also receive a push notification saying that you are successfully parked your vehicle in a parking space.

        ## WHAT IF I ENCOUNTER A TECHNICAL ISSUE OR SEE AN ERROR MESSAGE?
        If you experience a technical issue or receive an error message, open a support ticket in the Help Center (under the contact us section). Please include the email address or mobile number on your account and the details of your experience, including the error message and when you experienced the problem. Be sure to pay for your parking on-site or with another method while we resolve the issue!

        ## CAN I MOVE PARKING LOTS OR SPACES WHILE IN A SESSION?
        You cannot change a parking lot or space number once a session is started. If a session has been started in the incorrect location, please start a new session with the correct information. You cannot pay in one zone and park in another.

        ## CAN I PARK MULTIPLE CARS?
        Absolutely! If the license plate number isn't already saved to your account, simply add it before starting the parking session.

        ## HOW DO I ADD LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS TO MY ACCOUNT?
        Log in and select "My Account" then "Registered Vehicles" to view the LPNs saved to your account. Tap to “Add a Vehicle“.

        ## HOW DO I CHANGE THE PHONE NUMBER OR EMAIL ADDRESS ON MY ACCOUNT?
        You can use the ParkSmart app to change the phone number or email address on your account. In the app, login and select "My Account" and then "Personal Information" to update your phone number or email address.
